Food insecurity is indeed a global issue. There is always a hidden connection between food waste and hunger. Excess food from various food outlets and houses feeds bins instead of needy people. In the wake of the lockdown imposed last year, surplus stocks of grain â€” pegged at 65 lakh tonnes in the first four months of 2020 â€” continued to rot in godowns across India.
Access to food became extremely scarce for the poor, especially daily-wage laborers.  
So coming up with solution. Firstly, Location are imprecise and required more time to coordinate. We decided to introduce the concept called Hunger zone. Hunger zones are the areas where the hungry and poor people live in the community. These spots can be slums, orphanages, shelter homes, homeless people in the streets etc. Making these hunger zone data available to the user will help them to share the food easily where the user can find the nearest hunger zone details in that. 
Secondly, Hungry people complains that they getting expired food from donors. Food is a delicate commodity as it always expires. Few inputs from the donor will greatly help the Volunteers and moderators.
